# DATA3320 - Project 1: Seattle Weather Exploration

## Description:
The purpose of this project is to explore whether it rains more in Seattle, WA than in New York City, NY. We will be using data science methodology and creating graphs to answer this question.

## Requirements:
Software and packages that will be used include:

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Colab

## Data:

## Data Preparation:
Steps took to prepare the data include:

1. Inspect data sets
2. Convert data types where needed
3. Dropped unnecessary columns
4. Identify any missing values
5. Join the Seattle and NYC data sets
6. Convert data set into a tidy format
7. Impute missing values

The file "weather_data_preparation.ipynb" performs the data preparation and the file "clean_seattle_nyc_weather.csv" is the cleaned data set.

## Data Analysis:
Steps took to analyze the data include:

1. Brainstorm specific questions that can help us answer the overall problem
2. Create plots that answered those specific questions
3. Interpret the plots

The file that performs the data analysis is "weather_data_analysis.ipynb"
